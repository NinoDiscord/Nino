# How to use the bot?
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Nino/wiki)!

# Installation
## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) (optional)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [Redis](https://redis.io)

## Setting up the bot
1. Clone the repository using Git: ``git clone https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Nino`` (If you don't have Git, just go to "Clone or download" and click "Download ZIP" then extract)
2. Install dependencies with NPM (included in Node.js): ``npm i`` (or with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) ``yarn``)
3. Create an application.yml file in your working directory and fill it in (see the example for more information)
4. Compile TypeScript (install TypeScript with ``npm i -g typescript`` or with Yarn ``yarn global add typescript``): ``tsc``
5. Run the bot in the `dist` directory: ``node bot.js``
6. Invite the bot to your server: ``https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOTIDHERE&scope=bot`` (replace "BOTIDHERE" with your Discord bot's client id)

(4 and 5 can be bypassed by running ``npm run main``)

Bot credentials (+ extra information) and personal touches are obviously your responsibility. You should know this by now, I hope.

## Example application.yml
