/**
 * Represents the metadata of a legacy-based command.
 * @param name The name of the command, this cannot be over 32 characters.
 * @param description This must be the path to the localisation of the description itself.
 * @param aliases A list of aliases that the command can be executed with; same rules apply with the [name] attribute.
 * @param examples A list of examples that is shown with the `--help`/`-h` flags or when invoked with the `help` command.
 *                 This uses the templating language to support items like `{prefix}` and `{name}` in the examples.
 *
 * @param category The [category][CommandCategory] this command belongs to.
 * @param cooldown The cooldown of the command in seconds, later, it will support custom bucket types (i.e, guild, channel)
 *                 and possibly use Redis as a "cache?"
 *
 * @param ownerOnly If true, only the owners of the bot (defined under the `owners` config variable) can execute this command.
 * @param userPermissions A list of permissions that the user needs to execute this command. Due to constraints with Kotlin,
 *                        this has to be with the `Long` data type instead of Kord's `Permission` class due to annotations
 *                        being processed at compile time and not at runtime where it can be evaluated.
 *
 * @param botPermissions A list of permissions that Nino requires to execute this command. Read the KDoc on the [userPermissions]
 *                       attribute on why it is an [LongArray] and not an array of `Permission` objects.
