## Self-hosting
Before attempting to self-host Nino, we didn't plan for users to be able to self-host their own instance of Nino. Most builds are usually buggy and untested as of late, we do have a "stable" branch but it can be buggy sometimes! If you want to use cutting edge features that are most likely not finished, view the [edge](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Nino/tree/edge) branch for more details. The "stable" branch is master, so anything that should be stable will be added to the upstream.

We will not provide support on how to self-host Nino, use at your own risk! If you do not want to bother hosting it, you can always invite the [public instance](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=531613242473054229&scope=bot) which will be the same experience if you hosted it or not.

### Prerequisites
Before running your own instance of Nino, you will need the following tools:

- [Timeouts Service](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/timeouts) (Used for mutes and such or it'll not work!)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (Latest is always used in development, but LTS is recommended)
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) (12 is used in development but anything above 10 should fairly work!)
- [Redis](https://redis.io) (6.2 is used in development but above v5 should work)

If you're moving from v0 to v1, you will need your MongoDB instance before to port the database and [Rei](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Rei) installed on your system.

There is tools that are optional but are mostly recommended in some cases:

- [Sentry](https://sentry.io) - Useful to find out where errors are in a pretty UI
- [Docker](https://docker.com) - If you're a masochist and want to run a private instance with Docker
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) - Useful for fetching new updates easily.

### Setting up
There are 2 ways to setup Nino: using Docker or just doing shit yourself. Doing it yourself can very tedious
of how much Nino uses from v0 to v1 since Nino utilizes microservices! **☆♬○♩●♪✧♩((ヽ( ᐛ )ﾉ))♩✧♪●♩○♬☆**

### Docker
This step isn't finished due to the rewrite not being stable.

### Normal
This step isn't finished due to the rewrite not being stable.

### Migrating from v0.x -> v1.x
If you used v0.x in the past, this is the process on how to migrate:

- 1. Run `rei convert ...` to convert the documents into JSON, this process should take a while if there is a lot of cases or warnings.
- 2. Run `node scripts/migrate.js <directory>`, where `<directory>` is the directory Rei converted your database to.

## Example `config.yml` file
- Replace `<discord token>` with your Discord bot's token
- Replace `<username>` with your PostgreSQL database username
- Replace `<password>` with your PostgreSQL database password
- Replace `<host>` (under `database`) with your PostgreSQL database host, if running locally, just use `localhost` or `database` if on Docker
- Replace `<port>` with your PostgreSQL database port it's running, if running locally, set it to `5432`
- Replace `<host>` (under `redis`) with your Redis connection host, if running locally, just use `localhost` or `redis` if on Docker
- Replace `<auth>` with the authenication token you set in the [timeouts](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/timeouts) relay service.

```yml
environment: development
token: <discord token>

prefixes:
  - !

database:
  url: postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>

redis:
  host: <host>
  port: 6379

timeouts:
  port: 4025
  auth: <auth>
```
