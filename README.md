## Contributing
Before you get started to contribute to Nino, view our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Nino/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [code of conduct](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Nino/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Self-hosting
Before to self-host Nino, ***we will not give you support on how to run your own Nino!*** The source code is available for
education purposes, and is not meant to run on small instances. Also, we have not planned for people to self-host their own
instance of Nino, since the source code and the main bots ARE identical from the source code. And, most builds pushed
to this repository have NOT been tested in production environments, so bewarn before running! If you do encouter bugs
with the bot or running it, please report it in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Nino/issues) with the **bug**
label!

### Prerequisites
Before running your own instance of Nino, you will need the following required tools:

- [Timeouts Microservice](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/timeouts) **~** Used for mutes, bans, and more. This will not make Nino operate successfully.
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) **~** Main database for holding user or guild data. Recommended version is 10 or higher.
- [Redis](https://redis.io) **~** Open source in-memory database storage to hold entities for quick retrieval. Recommended version is 5 or higher.
- [Java](https://java.com) **~** Language compiler for Gradle and Kotlin. Required version is JDK 16 or higher.

If you're moving from **v0.x** -> **v2.x**, you will need to have your MongoDB instance and our utility for converting documents
into JSON, [Rei](https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Rei) before contiuning.

#### Extra Tooling
There is tools that are *optional* but are mostly not-recommended in most cases:

- [cluster-operator](https://github.com/MikaBot/cluster-operator) **~** Easily manages discord clustering between multiple nodes
- [Docker](https://docker.com) **~** Containerisation tool for isolation between the host and the underlying container.
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io) **~** Open-source application monitoring, with a focus on error reporting.

### Setup
You're almost there on how to run your instance! Before you frantically clone the repository and such, there is two options
on how to use Nino:

- Normally: You can spin up a **PM2** process to run Nino, which will run fine!
- Docker: Uses the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to run Nino in a isolated container seperated from your machine and the host.

#### Docker Setup
> Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è **BEFORE YOU CLONE, MAKE SURE DOCKER IS INSTALLED!**

1. **Clone the repository** using the `git clone` command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Nino [-b edge] # If you want to use cutting edge features,
# add the `-b edge` flag!
```

2. **Change the directory** to `Nino` or however you named it, and create a image:

```sh
$ cd Nino
$ docker build -t nino:latest --no-cache .
```

3. **Run the image** to start the bot!

```sh
# A volume is required for `.env` and `config.yml` so it can properly
# load your configuration!
$ docker run -d -v './config.yml:/app/Nino/config.yml:ro' -v './.env:/app/Nino/.env' nino:latest
```

4. **[OPTIONAL]** Use `docker-compose` to start all services.

```sh
# We provide a `docker-compose.yml` file so you can spin up the required
# services Nino requires without setting it up yourself.
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Normal Setup
> ‚úèÔ∏è **Make sure you have a service to run Nino like `systemd` or `pm2`.**

1. **Clone the repository** using the `git clone` command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NinoDiscord/Nino [-b edge] # If you want to use cutting edge features,
# add the `-b edge` flag!
```

2. **Install import dependencies**

```sh
$ ./gradlew tasks
```

3. **Build and compile** the Kotlin code

```sh
$ ./gradlew :bot:build
```

4. **Runs the project**

```sh
$ java -jar ./bot/build/libs/Nino.jar
```

## Migrations
There has many changes towards the database when it comes to Nino, since all major releases have some-what a database revision once a while.

### v0.x -> v2.x
If you used **v0.x** in the past and you want to use the **v2.x** version, you can run the following commands:

```sh
# Convert your MongoDB database into JSON file that the migrator script can read.
$ rei convert ...

# Runs the migrator script, if you're using Windows,
# use PowerShell: `./scripts/migrate.ps1`
$ ./scripts/migrate 0.x ./data
```

### v1.x -> v2.x
If you wish to migrate from **v1.x** towards **v2.x**, you can run the following commands:

```sh
# Runs the migrator script
# *NIX:
$ ./scripts/migrate 1.x --password=... --user=... --database=... --host=... --port=...

# PowerShell:
$ ./scripts/migrate.ps1 1.x -Password ... -User ... -Database ... -Host ... -Port ...
```

## Configuration
Nino's configurations are made up in a simple **config.yml** file located in the `root directory` of the project. The following keys
must be replaced:

- **Replace `<discord token>` with your [Discord bot's](https://discord.com/developers/applications) token.**
- **Replace `<redis host>` with your Redis host**
  - **If you are using Docker Compose, replace `<redis host>` with "redis" since Compose will link the host with the container.**
  - **If you're running it locally or the config key is not present, it'll infer as `localhost`**
- **Replace `<redis port>` with your Redis network port**
  - **If you are using Docker Compose, you can omit this config key since Compose will infer it to the redis container.**
  - **If you're running it locally or the config key is not present, it'll infer as `6379`**
- **Replace `<postgres host>` with your PostgreSQL host.**
  - **If you are using Docker Compose, replace `<postgres host>` with "postgres" since Compose will link the host with the container.**
  - **If you're running it locally or the config key is not present, it'll infer as `localhost`**
- **Replace `<postgres port>` with your Redis network port**
  - **If you are using Docker Compose, you can omit this config key since Compose will infer it to the redis container.**
  - **If you're running it locally or the config key is not present, it'll infer as `5432`**
